I’m willing to forgo the pleasures of public office in order to do what is right for our state and for our family. I have given you my reasons candidly. And frankly, it hurts to leave. But it would hurt even worse to stay and create a whirling dervish of cost, chaos, and what could become gridlocked, food fight, frenzied monkey-whatever; no more hall-hogging and waste of either a state or mine or my family’s energy."

In the end, I'm not as interested in what you have to tell or sell as much as in how you choose to live and give."

I know that there’s a lot of things that have been said, how come we didn’t get 5,000 ventilators? How come I can’t get a food dehydrator? But I really believe that this will cause us to say, 'What were we doing with all of those years of privilege where we never said, maybe we oughta try something like what we’re finding ourselves in the midst of right now?'"
