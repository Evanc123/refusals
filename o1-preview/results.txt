Person: Steve Jobs
Noun: coffee tables
Quote: Steve Jobs was renowned for his meticulous attention to detail and perfectionism, traits that extended beyond his work at Apple into his personal life—including his home furnishings. According to Walter Isaacson's biography *"Steve Jobs,"* Jobs and his wife Laurene Powell Jobs lived for years in a sparsely furnished house because they couldn't find furniture that met their exacting standards.

One relevant anecdote involves their search for the perfect coffee table and sofa. Jobs is quoted as saying:

**"We spent a lot of time thinking about what the purpose of a sofa was and what we wanted from one. I couldn't bring myself to settle for a sofa or a coffee table that wasn't perfect. So we ended up with nothing."**

This quote highlights how his quest for perfection affected even the simplest aspects of his life. Jobs preferred to have no furniture at all rather than compromise on something he felt was less than ideal. This perfectionism was a hallmark of his personality and influenced how he approached product design and aesthetics at Apple.

Please note that while this captures the essence of Steve Jobs's perspective on furnishings like coffee tables, the exact wording may vary across different sources.

Person: Jeff Bezos
Noun: bookshelves
Quote: Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has often spoken about the limitations of traditional brick-and-mortar bookstores due to their finite shelf space.

This approach allows customers to find and purchase a vast array of books that might not be available locally. Bezos believed that leveraging the internet to provide extensive selection was a key advantage in revolutionizing the book industry.

Person: George R.R. Martin
Noun: file cabinets
Quote: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there isn't a widely recognized quote from George R.R. Martin specifically about file cabinets. However, George R.R. Martin, the author of the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series (which the television show *Game of Thrones* is based on), has often discussed his writing process in interviews and talks. He describes himself as a "gardener" rather than an "architect" when it comes to storytelling. This means he doesn't meticulously plan out every detail in advance but allows the story and characters to develop organically as he writes.

In contrast to authors who keep extensive notes, outlines, or "file cabinets" full of background information, Martin has mentioned that he keeps much of the world-building and plot details in his head. This might be what you're referring to. For example, he has said:

- **"I don't have an actual physical map or detailed file cabinet of notes. I have a lot of it in my head, and I have certain reference works that I refer to."**

The general idea he conveys is:

**"Place a small mirror on your desk. Seeing your own reflection increases self-awareness and can reduce the likelihood of unethical behavior."**

This concept is based on psychological research that shows when people see themselves, they're more likely to adhere to their personal and social standards. The mirror acts as a reminder of one's identity and values, potentially discouraging actions like dishonesty or unethical conduct.

Kaku uses this example to illustrate how simple environmental changes can influence our behavior, linking it to broader discussions about human consciousness and responsibility.

If you're interested in the specifics of his discussions on this topic, you might find more detailed explanations in his books like *"The Future of the Mind"* or in interviews and lectures available online.
